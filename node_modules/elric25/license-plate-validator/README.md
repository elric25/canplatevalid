# License Plate Validator

Based on the work of @randock and his license plate validator for various european countries

This package is intended for use to validate license plates from all of the provinces and territories of Canada, taking into account different lengths
and specific code differences. Do note that the validator cannot accomodate for customized license plates and some niche situations for license plates may not be accounted for.

```typescript
import { ValidatorFactory } from 'elric25/license-plate-validator';

// obtain a validator instance
const validator = ValidatorFactory.forCountry('NL');

// validate license plate
const valid: boolean = validator.validate('XX-YY-ZZ'); // true

// format license plate (result is a string array)
const formats: string[] = validator.format('11YYZZ'); // ["11-YY-ZZ"]
```

For some countries, the format cannot be deduced to only one possible format. For example, the German license plate "DES123" can either be DE S 123 (Dessau) or D ES 123 (DÃ¼sseldorf). That is why the result of the format method is always an array of strings.
